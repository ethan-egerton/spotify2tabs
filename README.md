> This extension is currently only available for Firefox.

## How To Use

Whilst listening to any song using the Spotify Web Player, press the Spotify2Tabs icon on your toolbar to immediately show the guitar tabs for the current song. The addon will deactivate when the active tab isn't the Spotify Web Player.

## Download

You can [download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/spotify2tabs/) the latest version of Spotify2Tabs via the Firefox Browser Add-ons website.

## How it works

The extension activates once it detects you are tabbed into the Spotify Web Player. When pressed, the extension takes the song and artist name directly from the now-playing-bar and opens a new tab with the search results of [https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/](ultimate-guitar.com).

I made this because it was a hassle to type in the song name every time I wanted to play a song on my guitar.
