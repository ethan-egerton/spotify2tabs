> This extension is currently only available for Firefox.

## How To Use

Whilst listening to any song using the Spotify Web Player, press the guitar icon located near the volume controls in the bottom right. A new tab will then be opened with the tab to the song you are currently listening to. To change the filters on tabs, press the Spotify2Tabs icon to open the menu, then select the filter.

## Download

You can [download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/spotify2tabs/) the latest version of Spotify2Tabs via the Firefox Browser Add-ons website.

## How it works

This extension inserts a button into the Spotify Web Player. When pressed, the extension takes the song and artist name directly from the now-playing-bar and opens a new tab with the search results of [https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/](ultimate-guitar.com). The settings are stored in and retrived from browser storage.

I made this because it was a hassle to type in the song name every time I wanted to play a song on my guitar.
